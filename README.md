Simple Anki addon for automatically reducing a full dictionary entry gotten from Yomichan/Yomitan/Rikaitan etc. into just the part that pertains to the specific example sentence used for the word. Also generates new meanings when no dict entry is present.

Intended to be used with a deck structure where you have multiple notes for different meanings of a
word which each contains an example sentence for that particular meaning.
